# Sayna API endpoint for LiveKit token generation
# This should point to your backend server that generates LiveKit tokens.
# The backend handles authentication and returns tokens from the Sayna API.
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit secrets or real API keys to version control.
# The backend is not part of this example - you must implement it separately.
#
# See ../saysdk/node-sdk/README.md or ../saysdk/python-sdk/README.md for
# backend implementation examples.
